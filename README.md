Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where models are trained on labeled data to 10 predict outcomes. In this report, I explore the application of Decision Trees (DT), Artificial Neural 11 Networks (ANN), and Boosting Algorithms to predictive maintenance, a critical task in industrial 12 settings. Predictive maintenance aims to identify potential equipment failures before they occur, 13 reducing downtime and maintenance costs. These algorithms are particularly well-suited for this 14 task because they can handle both numerical and categorical data, capture complex decision 15 boundaries, and provide interpretable results. 16
I analyzed two datasets: the Industrial Equipment Monitoring Dataset and the Machine Failure 17 Prediction Dataset, using DT, ANN, and Boosting algorithms to classify equipment faults and 18 machine failures. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in predictive 19 maintenance applications, with Boosting showing the highest accuracy. Several visualizations, 20 including confusion matrices, learning curves, and feature importance plots, are provided to 21 illustrate the models' performance and insights.
